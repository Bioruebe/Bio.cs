# BioLib (*Bio.cs*)

A helper library used in most of my C# projects.

It contains a variety of small functions to simplify common tasks, such as string manipulation, file I/O and user interaction via command line.

## Installation

Install the package [Bioruebe.BioLib](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Bioruebe.BioLib/) with NuGet.
